# GetSetTask
GetSetTask is a project management application made with Windows Presentation Foundation(WPF). The application allows users to create projects, tasks, check lists, and comments to help organize progress and ideas for personal projects. All profile information is stored locally in a /Profiles/ folder within the directory of the application, so internet connection isn't required to use GetSetTask. However, be warned that if the profiles are deleted for any reason, any information stored for this application will be lost.
